---

My name is Dasol Kim. I have the following qualities:

- deliberate, adventurous, faithful, radiant
- I have a few experiences to join project as a web (front/server) developer and mobile application developer. And these days I am really into studying ML/DL as well.

What else do you like?

- I often spend my time reading novels, doing pilates and learning new languages(ps. Korean and English are my primary languages.)
- I went to Canada as my exchange and it inspirse me to dream about working abroad in the future. So I'm gonna write down all of my posts in English.

### My story

I am majoring in Statistics and Computer Science. I have sufficient fundamental knowledge on these two fields and problem solving skills to face with challenges. I would like to record what I did learn from studying alone from now on.
